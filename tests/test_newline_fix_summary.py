Summary test demonstrating the newline preservation fix for book pagination.

ISSUE: When reading a book with multiple pages, newlines in the text file were being skipped.

ROOT CAUSE: 
1. The _paginate_text() method was using string replacement to split sentences, which 
   lost newline characters during the split/join process.
2. The _display_page() method was using textwrap.fill() which collapses all whitespace,
   including paragraph breaks (double newlines).

FIX:
1. Modified _paginate_text() to preserve newlines by:
   - Temporarily replacing '\n' with a unique marker before sentence splitting
   - Restoring the newlines after splitting
   - Adjusting the sentence split logic to preserve spaces between sentences

2. Modified _display_page() to preserve paragraph structure by:
   - Splitting text by double newlines (paragraph breaks) first
   - Wrapping each paragraph individually
   - Rejoining with blank lines between paragraphs

This test verifies the fix works correctly.
