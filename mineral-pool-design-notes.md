The mineral pools are not just a dungeon—they are a sacred and corrupted space that sets the stage for Jean's journey. Their layout should reflect this, showing the player both the beauty of the world and the dangers lurking within it.

Here is a detailed layout for the mineral pools:
## The Sacred Atrium
The entrance to the mineral pools is a wide, magnificent cavern that serves as an antechamber. It is a place of reverence for the Golemites, a natural cathedral of stone.
 * The Path: A smooth, sloping path leads down from the Golemite city. The air grows cooler and damper here, carrying the subtle, clean scent of wet rock.
 * The Uncorrupted Pools: The atrium is dominated by a series of small, pristine, spring-fed pools. The water is a luminous, milky blue, and it flows in gentle streams that carve intricate, swirling patterns into the polished stone floor. This area is completely free of slimes, allowing the player to appreciate the beauty of the pools as they were meant to be. This also gives the player a moment of peace before the action begins. A healing spring may be appropriate in one of the tiles here.
 * Golemite Tools: Along the walls of the atrium, there are various Golemite tools—stone picks and chisels—that have been carefully laid out. This shows that the Golemites recently attempted to cleanse the pools, but were forced to retreat.

## The Corrupted Channels
Beyond the Sacred Atrium, the pools become a dangerous, corrupted maze. The elegant, flowing streams turn into stagnant, slimy channels.
 * The Color Change: The water here is a sickly, iridescent green, and a thick, goopy slime coats the walls and floors. The air now carries a sour, unnatural smell.
 * Slime Habitats: The slimes themselves are everywhere, lurking in the green water or jiggling along the slick stone paths. Some of the stone itself appears to be dissolving where the corruption is worst, with cracks spreading outward from the pools. This reinforces why the Golemites couldn't enter this area.
 * A Navigable Maze: The layout of the Corrupted Channels is a series of interconnected caverns and narrow passages. The player must navigate by hopping across stone platforms and carefully avoiding particularly deep, slimy sections. Obstacles could include:
   * Slime Bridges: Narrow stone walkways that are coated in a slippery, green film, requiring careful movement.
   * Pulsing Glands: Strange, bulbous growths on the walls that occasionally spit out smaller, more aggressive slimes.
   * Mini-Boss Caverns: Small, enclosed caverns with larger groups of slimes that must be defeated to unlock the path forward.

## The Heart of the Infestation
At the very end of the Corrupted Channels lies a massive, circular cavern that feels like the source of all the sickness. This is the arena for the King Slime.
 * The Central Pool: The cavern is dominated by a single, enormous pool of pulsating, vibrant green slime. The pool is so thick and viscous that it appears to have a heartbeat.
 * The King Slime: The King Slime itself is a colossal, wobbly creature that fills the center of the pool. Its body is littered with shiny, jagged mineral fragments it has consumed, a visual hint to the special fragment it holds.
 * A Single Platform: There is a single, large, un-corrupted rock island in the center of the pool, which serves as the main battle platform. The player must defeat the King Slime here, surrounded by the very corruption it has spread.
 * Post-Battle: After the King Slime is defeated, the pulsating green slime in the pool rapidly dissolves, revealing the pure, luminescent blue water below, and leaving the valuable mineral fragment floating on a single, clean stone.


## The Secret of the Luminous Vein
Hidden away from the main, sludgy channels is a small, pristine grotto. The player would have to actively search for it, perhaps noticing a subtle shift in the wall's texture or a faint, clean scent amidst the corruption.
 * The Entrance: The entrance to the grotto is a narrow, almost-hidden crevice in the wall of the Corrupted Channels, disguised by a thick layer of goop. Jean would have to find a way to clear the slime to see the small passage.
 * The Puzzle: Inside the grotto, the air is clean and smells of fresh stone. The walls are not slimy, but embedded with luminous mineral veins that pulse with a soft glow. At the center of the grotto, a large, hollowed-out geode sits on a pedestal. Around the geode are three smaller, empty mineral depressions. The player's job is to discover which minerals, from a pool of scattered gems found throughout the level, must be placed in these depressions to unlock the geode.
The clues for this puzzle are simple, but require close observation:
 * A subtle etching on a wall in the Sacred Atrium shows a Golemite ritual, with three specific mineral symbols arranged in a sequence.
 * The color and shape of the glowing veins in the grotto subtly correspond to the required gems.
When the correct three minerals are placed in the correct order, the luminous veins pulse brightly, and the large geode on the pedestal cracks open with a low hum.
 * The Thematic Reward: Inside the geode, the player finds a single, glowing piece of enchanted armor or a weapon. This item isn't just a random piece of loot; it is a long-lost Golemite creation, a piece of gear that has absorbed the raw, pure energy of the sacred pools and is now ready to be reclaimed. The item's enchantment could be a defensive bonus against slimy attacks or an extra bit of armor against physical damage, which fits the theme of the area. This quest rewards players who take the time to explore and connect with the world on a deeper level.
