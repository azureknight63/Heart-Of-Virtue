# The World of Aurelion
## Geography
Aurelion is a vast and diverse world, characterized by its unique geological formations and rich ecosystems. The landscape is dominated by towering stone citadels, expansive warrens, and shifting sand dunes that create a dynamic environment. The central region, known as the Verdette Plains, is a lush area filled with vibrant flora and fauna, while the outskirts are marked by arid deserts and rocky terrains.

## Inhabitants
The world is home to various intelligent species, each with their own cultures and societies. The Golemites, a race of stone-like beings, are the primary inhabitants of the underground citadels. They are known for their strength, resilience, and deep connection to the earth. Other species include the Sandwalkers, nomadic tribes that traverse the shifting sands, and the Verdant Folk, who dwell in the lush regions of Aurelion.

## History
Aurelion has a rich history marked by periods of conflict and cooperation among its inhabitants. Ancient texts speak of a time when the Golemites and Sandwalkers formed alliances to fend off external threats, leading to a golden age of prosperity. However, as resources dwindled, tensions arose, resulting in territorial disputes and wars that shaped the current political landscape.

## Creation
Legends tell of Aurelion's creation as a result of a cosmic event, where celestial forces collided, giving birth to the land and its diverse ecosystems. The Golemites believe they were formed from the very stones of the earth, imbued with life by the ancient spirits that govern the world. This connection to the land is central to their identity and way of life.

## Out-of-Context Information
In terms of the story arc, the world of Aurelion was specifically created by God to help Jean come to terms with the loss of his family and find a new purpose. The challenges he faces in this world are designed to mirror his internal struggles, allowing him to grow and heal through his adventures and relationships with the inhabitants of Aurelion. The world itself is a testament to the extreme lengths God will go to in order to save just one soul, and yet God does so with a gentle hand, crafting a place of wonder and growth rather than despair, and allowing Jean to cooperate with God's plan rather than being forced into it.
