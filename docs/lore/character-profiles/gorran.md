## The Steadfast Companion
Gorran is not just a protector; he's a veteran, a steadfast guardian of his people. He's roughly 1,500 years old, which, in Golemite years, is a seasoned adult but not yet ancient. Golemites live for thousands of years, so in human terms, he would be around 45 to 55 years old—old enough to be wise and experienced, but still in his prime.

## A History Forged in Stone
Gorran's life has been a long series of challenges and quiet victories, all centered on his duty to the Golemite people.

### The War of the Shifting Sands:
Gorran earned his star-shaped moss patch during a great conflict known as the War of the Shifting Sands. A group of hostile, fast-moving sand elementals threatened to collapse the Golemites' most sacred caverns. Gorran, still a young Golemite, led a defensive unit that held the line for days against impossible odds. His body was battered and cracked, and a deep wound on his shoulder began to grow a unique patch of luminous moss, a permanent mark of his sacrifice and endurance. This experience taught him the value of patience and the strength that comes from a united front.

### The Great Quiet: 
Following the war, Gorran was tasked with a solitary mission: to stand watch over a collapsed section of the Warrens, a passage that had been sealed to protect the city. For centuries, he stood alone, his only companions the slow trickle of water and the grinding of stone. This long solitude taught him to be observant and patient, and to find meaning in the quiet moments. It also made him uniquely suited to sense the subtle distress that led him to find Jean.

### The Unspoken Grief: 
Like humans, Golemites experience loss. Gorran once had a deep bond with another Golemite, his life partner in all things. They were a pair, responsible for maintaining a large section of the city. A terrible rockslide claimed his companion, leaving Gorran to shoulder their shared duty alone. Golemites grieve differently than humans; they don't cry, but their form becomes rougher, and their movements slower. Gorran carries this unspoken grief with him, and it’s why he is so immediately drawn to Jean's sadness. He sees a reflection of his own pain in Jean's apparent sense of loss.

## Family and Community
Golemite society is built not on family ties as humans know them, but on deep and lasting bonds of brotherhood. A Golemite's most profound relationships are forged through shared duty and purpose, forming small, close-knit groups that work and live together for centuries. These are not "couples," but brother-in-arms, each relying on the other for strength and counsel.

### The Nature of their Bonds: 
The bond is one of mutual respect, shared hardship, and steadfast loyalty. When a Golemite loses a close companion, as Gorran did, it's a loss as profound as that of a brother. Their form may become rougher and their movements slower, but their communal grieving is what helps them endure.

### A "Male" Society: 
The Golemites are a single-gender race. Their society, born of stone and duty, is centered around the concepts of strength, endurance, and quiet resolve. These traits give their community a focused, purpose-driven identity.

### Communal Rearing
The creation of new Golemites is a slow, spiritual process. A new Golemite doesn't have parents; he simply awakens from the earth in a sacred mineral deposit, which is a natural extension of the world itself. Once he awakens, he is immediately taken in and cared for by the entire community.
Instead of a single family, the young Golemite learns and grows under the guidance of every Golemite in the city. An Elder might teach him about history, a warrior might teach him about duty, and a craftsman might teach him about artistry. This communal rearing ensures that every Golemite understands his purpose and his unbreakable connection to his people.
This structure reframes Gorran's protectiveness of Jean. He isn't just taking on a ward; he's extending the very foundation of his society—brotherhood and communal care—to a lost soul who desperately needs it.
