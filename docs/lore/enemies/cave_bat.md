# Cave Bat
Cave Bats are nocturnal creatures that dwell in dark caves and underground tunnels. They have a distinctive appearance with leathery wings, sharp fangs, and glowing red eyes that pierce through the darkness. Their fur is a dark brown or black color, allowing them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings.

## Behavior
Cave Bats are highly agile and use echolocation to navigate through the pitch-black environments they inhabit. They are primarily insectivorous, feeding on cave-dwelling insects and small creatures. When threatened, they can emit high-pitched screeches to disorient predators and prey alike.

## Special Abilities
- **Echolocation:** Cave Bats can emit ultrasonic sounds to detect obstacles and prey in complete darkness.
- **Swarm Tactics:** They often attack in groups, overwhelming their targets with sheer numbers.
- **Stealth:** Their dark coloration and silent flight make them difficult to detect until they are very close.
- **Drain Life:** Some Cave Bats possess the ability to drain a small amount of life energy from their victims, weakening them over time.
- **Night Vision:** Cave Bats have excellent night vision, allowing them to see clearly in low-light conditions.
- **Flight Agility:** Their ability to maneuver quickly in tight spaces makes them formidable opponents in their natural habitat.
- **Vampiric Bite:** Cave Bats can suck blood from their victims, restoring their own health while harming the target.
