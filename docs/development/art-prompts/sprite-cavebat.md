# Sprite sheets: Cave Bat

Slug: `cavebat`  
Side: enemy

One image per clip. Deliver each as the file name shown; the intake tool slices it by the stated grid and normalises frames to 64x64.

## idle -- deliver as `cavebat__idle.png` (3 rows x 4 cols)

```text
SUBJECT: A cave bat: a small leathery-winged bat, dark brown to black fur, membranous wings, short hooked claws, faintly glowing amber eyes. Always airborne -- idle is a hovering wing-beat, walk is a swooping flight, attack is a dive-bite, death is a tumble to the ground with wings crumpled. Accent colour: faint amber eyes.

ANIMATION: 'idle' -- breathing / weight-shift loop used whenever the combatant is waiting. Exactly 4 frames per row, a smooth loop where the clip is a loop (idle, walk) and a clean start-to-end sequence otherwise. The pose must be recognisably the same character in all 12 cells.

LAYOUT: a single PNG containing a strict 3 x 4 grid of equal square cells (3 rows, 4 columns), every cell the same size, with hairline gaps of solid magenta (#FF00FF) between cells and a solid magenta background behind every cell. One sprite per cell, centred, feet on the same baseline in every cell, identical scale in every cell. Row 1 = facing SOUTH (toward the viewer), row 2 = facing WEST (left), row 3 = facing NORTH (away). Columns are the animation frames in order, left to right. Do not draw anything outside the cells.

STYLE: 16-bit pixel art sprite sheet, crisp hand-placed pixels, no anti-aliasing, no blur, no gradients, no outlines thicker than one pixel. 3/4 top-down RPG view (camera pitched about 60 degrees, as in a SNES-era tactical RPG). Muted, slightly desaturated palette with one strong accent colour per character. Dark-fantasy tone: worn, practical, grounded. Read clearly at 48 px on a dark #0a0a0a field. No text, no labels, no watermark, no drop shadow (the game draws its own).
