The Steadfast Companion
Gorran is not just a protector; he's a veteran, a steadfast guardian of his people. He's roughly 1,500 years old, which, in Golemite years, is a seasoned adult but not yet ancient. Golemites live for thousands of years, so in human terms, he would be around 45 to 55 years old—old enough to be wise and experienced, but still in his prime.
A History Forged in Stone
Gorran's life has been a long series of challenges and quiet victories, all centered on his duty to the Golemite people.
The War of the Shifting Sands: Gorran earned his star-shaped moss patch during a great conflict known as the War of the Shifting Sands. A group of hostile, fast-moving sand elementals threatened to collapse the Golemites' most sacred caverns. Gorran, still a young Golemite, led a defensive unit that held the line for days against impossible odds. His body was battered and cracked, and a deep wound on his shoulder began to grow a unique patch of luminous moss, a permanent mark of his sacrifice and endurance. This experience taught him the value of patience and the strength that comes from a united front.
The Great Quiet: Following the war, Gorran was tasked with a solitary mission: to stand watch over a collapsed section of the Warrens, a passage that had been sealed to protect the city. For centuries, he stood alone, his only companions the slow trickle of water and the grinding of stone. This long solitude taught him to be observant and patient, and to find meaning in the quiet moments. It also made him uniquely suited to sense the subtle distress that led him to find Jean.
The Unspoken Grief: Like humans, Golemites experience loss. Gorran once had a deep bond with another Golemite, his life partner in all things. They were a pair, responsible for maintaining a large section of the city. A terrible rockslide claimed his companion, leaving Gorran to shoulder their shared duty alone. Golemites grieve differently than humans; they don't cry, but their form becomes rougher, and their movements slower. Gorran carries this unspoken grief with him, and it’s why he is so immediately drawn to Jean's sadness. He sees a reflection of his own pain in the boy's lost look.
Family and Community
Golemite "families" are not built on blood, but on geological bonds and shared purpose. They are formed when Golemites choose a partner to live and work with for centuries, maintaining a specific part of the Warrens. They do not have children in the human sense; new Golemites are formed naturally from the earth itself, a slow process that happens only in certain sacred mineral deposits. These new Golemites are then adopted by older pairs and taught the ways of their people.
Gorran’s connection to his companion was a deep, centuries-long bond of shared duty and affection. When he saw Jean, a lost and scared being, he saw an echo of his own isolated grief, and in saving him, he found a new purpose. Gorran's protectiveness of Jean isn't just a duty to Votha Krr; it's a personal, heartfelt commitment, an attempt to find meaning and connection again after a long and painful loss.
