Kragg's backstory is no longer just about a fussy gem collector; it's about a being created with a specific purpose in the divine plan. Here is a fleshed-out history for him that ties directly into the new lore.
The Keeper of Remnants
Kragg was not born like other Golemites, slowly forming from the earth's minerals. He was forged at the moment of the world's creation, a direct and intentional act of divine will. His crystalline form is a reflection of his purpose: to be a keeper of remnants, an archivist of the world's most beautiful and broken pieces.
While other Golemites are a part of the earth, Kragg is a steward of it. He was given the task of collecting and preserving the fragments of the world's creation—the brilliant geodes, the rare minerals, and the precious stones that carry the echoes of the world's birth. This is why he is a "Gem-Grinder." He does not simply trade; he refines and polishes, bringing out the inherent beauty and purpose in each stone, a reflection of God's desire to find beauty even in the broken.
A Purpose in Purity and Flaw
Kragg's meticulous and perfectionist nature is not a quirk; it is an intrinsic part of his divine design. He can sense the minute imperfections in a gem, the cracks and flaws that a normal Golemite would overlook. This ability is a metaphor for his role in Jean's journey. Kragg's fastidiousness and a keen eye for flaws will be used to help Jean, and it's a foreshadowing of the work Jean must do within himself.
The Sorting Bins: The "Sorting Bins" where Kragg keeps his flawed gems are a physical manifestation of his understanding that even imperfect things have value. They represent the "broken places" that Votha Krr mentioned. Kragg sees beauty in the flawed stones, just as God sees value in the brokenness of Jean.
The Unique Collectibles: The single, unique artifact on the pedestal in his shop is not a random item. It is a "remnant," a piece of the world's past that carries a powerful, concentrated energy. Kragg is meant to keep these safe until the right person, the one who needs its specific power or message, arrives. For Jean, finding these will be part of his spiritual journey—each collectible could be a piece of a puzzle, a tool for healing, or a subtle message from God.
A Golemite Apart
Kragg lives a solitary existence, apart from the other Golemites. They see his obsession with perfection as strange, and his constant tinkling is an oddity to their low rumbles. He is a divine observer, a quiet presence whose purpose is not to fight alongside Jean, but to prepare the tools and artifacts Jean will need to heal and to see the world's truth. He is a living testament to the idea that even the most seemingly insignificant or strange beings can have a vital role in a divine plan. His existence affirms the moral of the story: every part of this world was created with intention, with the sole purpose of guiding Jean home.
