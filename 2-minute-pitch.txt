Hello there!
I've been working on a game concept I'm really excited about, and I wanted to pitch it to you. It's an action-adventure RPG called Heart of Virtue, and it's built around a very personal journey.
Imagine this: You wake up in a strange fantasy world with no memory of who you are or how you got there. Your name is Jean, and your only clue is a deep, unsettling feeling that you've lost something—or someone—very important. Your journey begins with a simple goal: find a way back home.
You'll explore a world that feels incredibly real, with its living stone creatures called Golemites and its strange, echoing caves. As you progress, you'll slowly regain your memories in small, powerful flashes, discovering the truth of your past and what brought you here.
Along the way, you’ll be guided by characters who are more than just allies. There's Gorran, a veteran Golemite who saves you and becomes a steadfast companion, like a big brother. You'll meet Votha Krr, a wise Elder who senses the pain in your soul, and others who exist to help you on your path.
The game is about more than fighting monsters and collecting loot. It's a journey through the stages of grief. The ultimate villain you’ll fight, a creature known as the Mind-Eater, is the physical manifestation of your own inner turmoil.
This all leads to a climactic moment on the highest peak of the world. The Mind-Eater is defeated, and a portal opens. You have a choice: abandon this world and return to your old reality, or choose to stay and fight to save this world and the friends you've made. The outcome of that choice will determine your destiny.
The final moral of the story is that even after a devastating loss, finding a new purpose and a new hope can lead to a profound redemption. It's a game about the ultimate power of compassion and the strength it takes to face your past.
So, what do you think?
