This is a text adventure/roleplaying game. Still taking shape, but getting cooler by the day.

Since I started working on this using a tutorial (http://letstalkdata.com/2014/08/how-to-write-a-text-adventure-in-python/), I can't take credit for some of the foundational code, though most of it has been replaced at this point. Kudos to @phillipjohnson for the leg-up.

Jean Claire wakes up to find himself in a mysterious cave. With no idea how he got there, he sets out to explore his surroundings and find his way back home. On the way, he will have to overcome many trials, meet new friends (and enemies,) and make difficult choices. The game will explore themes about what it means to be a human person, sacrifice, suffering, joy, love, and faith, while remaining limited in scope to pack a lot of detail into a suitable space.

The game has no graphics except for alphanumeric characters. The focus here is on content and mechanics, not pretty graphics.

In terms of length, I'd like to keep a single playthrough to within 3-5 hours. This will help me actually publish a game instead of having it sit in development for all eternity :)

Stay tuned for further updates.
