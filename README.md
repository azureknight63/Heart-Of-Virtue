# Heart-Of-Virtue
Adventure RPG
Follow former crusader Jean Claire into a strange and dangerous world as he tries to make sense of his situation and piece together the fragments of his tragic past.

This is a text RPG - all graphics are represented using text characters! The human mind is far better at producing images than any pixel editor.
