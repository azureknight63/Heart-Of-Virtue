There are scuff marks on the floor that stop abruptly where the wall and floor meet. Jean can hear the muffled sound of flowing water~	BlankTile|@Tile_Description.1.A long rock ledge juts out from the opening to the west, crossing the chasm below and connecting to another rock wall to the east. The sunlight is blinding, with an open sky overhead. Far below, a river rushes beneath the ledge, spraying water in all directions as it crashes against the walls. The twittering of nearby birds can be heard. Banding to the east and west, a line of rock spires can be seen, including the two adjacent walls, all presumably connected by similar rock ledges. There's a warm breeze blowing mildly from the north~	BlankTile|!Block.east|@Tile_Description.1.The rock ledge continues to the east and terminates as it reaches the wall. From this vantage point, large mountains can be seen to the northwest, covered in white clouds at their crowns~|@Wall_Switch.1.!Story:start_open_bridgewall	EmptyCave			Boundary
