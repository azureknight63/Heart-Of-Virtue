Chapter 1: Awakening and First Steps
 
 Jean's Disoriented Awakening
 
  * Jean wakes up in a cave, disoriented and unsure how they got there. They
    have no memory of how they entered, only a vague, unsettling feeling that
    something terrible has happened, though they can't place what. The cave
    feels like a strange, immediate refuge.
  * Finds a secret door to exit the first chamber, perhaps by solving a simple
    environmental puzzle.
  * Emerges to a breathtaking vista of the surrounding area: a winding river
    below, imposing rock formations, and a sprawling field leading to distant,
    jagged mountains. This is a moment for player awe, establishing the scale
    of the world.
 
 Encounter and Golemite Rescue
 
  * Enters a second chamber. The atmosphere here feels different, subtly
    unsettling.
  * Discovers an old, sturdy chest in the chamber.
    * Opening the chest reveals a basic sword and a pouch of gold pieces.
    * The act of opening the chest triggers the awakening of Rock Rumblers â€“
      earth elemental creatures that burst from the ground or walls. This serves
      as the player's first combat tutorial.
  * After defeating the initial Rock Rumblers, a brief cutscene shows Jean
    frantically running, disoriented by the unexpected attack.
  * Another battle triggers against a single, more aggressive Rumbler. Jean
    gets cornered, appearing on the verge of defeat.
  * Just as hope seems lost, a formidable Golemite named Gorran intervenes,
    smashing the Rumbler with raw power. The remaining Rumblers, intimidated,
    retreat.
    * Gorran is distinctly identifiable by a unique, star-shaped patch of
      luminous moss on its left shoulder.
  * Gorran emits a series of low, rumbling sounds and gestures for Jean to
    follow.
  * Gorran then reveals a hidden entrance, leading to the Verdette Caverns.
  * Jean, still disoriented but grateful, follows Gorran, who seems to understand
    the urgency of Jean's situation.
  * As they traverse the caverns, Gorran communicates through gestures and
    rumbling sounds, indicating that Jean should stay close and be cautious.
  * Gorran leads Jean through a series of winding paths, avoiding more Rock
    Rumblers and other dangers, showcasing Gorran's strength and protective
    nature.
  * Eventually, they are beset by a creature known as a Lurker.
    * The Lurker is a large, shadowy creature that emerges from the walls,
      attempting to ambush them.
  * Gorran fights valiantly, but the Lurker proves to be a formidable foe.
  * It's a tense battle, but the two eventually prevail.
  * Gorran then opens a hidden passage, revealing a way out of the caverns and 
  into the Rock Warrens, a vast underground network inhabited by the
  Golemites. At the center of the Warrens is a large chamber, where the 
  underground city of Grondia is located.
  
 
 Arrival in Grondia and Elder's Plea
 
  * Jean follows Gorran into Grondia, the central hub of the Rock Warrens.
  * Gorran leads Jean to a large tower in the center of the city known as
    the Citadel, where the Golemite Elders convene.
  * Jean meets Elder Votha Krr, an ancient and wise Golemite, who is distinguished by
    his rare ability to speak human languages.
    * Votha Krr formally introduces Gorran as Jean's rescuer.
    * Votha Krr offers assistance to Jean, but explains that the Golemites face
      a dire internal crisis: Slimes have infested their sacred mineral pools,
      threatening their vital resources.
    * The Elder proposes a pact: If Jean can successfully eradicate the Slimes
      from the mineral pools, Votha Krr will provide the help Jean needs. This
      establishes the player's first major quest.
 
 Exploration and the King Slime
 
  * Jean is now free to explore the Rock Warrens. A Golemite merchant is
    available for trade using gestures and rumbles.
  * Jean proceeds to the mineral pools to clear out the Slimes. Gorran does not
    accompany Jean into the King Slime's lair, allowing Jean to face this
    challenge alone.
  * Deeper within the pools, Jean confronts and defeats a particularly vicious
    King Slime.
    * Upon defeat, the King Slime's form rapidly destabilizes, revealing a
      singular, exceptionally large, and exquisitely faceted rare mineral
      fragment it had consumed or coalesced around. The fragment looks
      unnaturally pristine and impossibly sharp.
  * Memory Trigger: As Jean instinctively reaches out to claim the mineral
    fragment, its razor-sharp edge slices deep into their finger. The sudden,
    intense pain acts as a shock to Jean's subconscious.
    * A violent, fragmented memory erupts: a deafening BOOM, human screams, a
      blinding flash of white light followed by darkness and swirling debris,
      and an overwhelming feeling of being thrown through the air and a
      gut-wrenching emptiness where something warm should have been in Jean's
      arms.
    * Jean is disoriented and profoundly shaken, struggling to rationalize the
      horrifying sensory overload that directly contradicts their amnesiac
      state.
 
 Votha Krr's Insight and Next Steps
 
  * Shortly after the King Slime's defeat and Jean's memory flash, Gorran
    arrives, sensing Jean's distress. Gorran observes Jean's reaction and the
    bleeding finger with concern.
  * Jean returns to Grondia and presents the rare mineral fragment to Votha Krr.
  * Votha Krr, with surprising levity, immediately crunches and consumes the
    valuable mineral fragment, a soft, contented rumble escaping the Elder.
  * Votha Krr regards Jean with a deeper, more knowing gaze. "The pools are
    clean, little one. You have done well. The corruption is gone, but I sense...
    a great disturbance within you. A sorrow that is not of this stone. The
    world outside these stones holds many shards. Some bring strength, some
    bring pain. Sometimes, the deepest truths are found in the broken places."
  * Votha Krr then advises Jean: "To mend what is broken, one must first
    understand the cracks. Go now. Seek the Echoing Caves to the west, beyond
    the river. There, the earth sings the songs of lost things. Perhaps you
    will find a different kind of strength there... or, at the very least, a
    clearer path."
