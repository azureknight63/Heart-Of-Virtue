ch1
    Jean wakes up in cave
    finds secret door to exit first chamber
    sees vista of surrounding area (river below, rock formations, field and mountains in distance)
    enters second chamber
        finds chest in chamber containing a sword and gold pieces
        opening the chest triggers the awakening of Rock Rumblers
    after defeating Rock Rumblers, scene triggers with Jean running away
    another battle triggers against single Rumbler, after which Jean gets cornered and rescued by a Golemite named Gorran
        Gorran has a unique star-shaped patch of moss on its left shoulder
        Gorran smashes a Rumbler, the rest run away
        Gorran rumbles at Jean and beckons Jean to follow
        Gorran opens a hidden door, revealing the entrance to the Rock Warrens (Golemite underground city)
    Jean follows Gorran to Grondia, where Jean meets Elder Votha Krr
        Votha Krr is an ancient Golemite who has learned to speak human languages. He is one of the few Golemites
          throughout history to learn this
        Votha Krr introduces the Golemite who saved Jean as Gorran
        Votha Krr offers to help Jean, but the Golemites have bigger problems right now. Slimes have infested the
          mineral pools and need to be eradicated. If Jean clears them out, Votha Krr promises to help.
    Jean may now explore the Rock Warrens, though the inhabitants aren't much for conversation. There is a
      merchant who will trade with Jean using gestures and rumbles. When ready, Jean moves to the mineral pool
      to clean up the slimes.
