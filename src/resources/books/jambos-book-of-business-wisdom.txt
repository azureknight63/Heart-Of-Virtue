JAMBO'S LITTLE BOOK OF BIG DEALS
(Or: How to Turn a Profit Without Losing Your Soul)

Listen, friend! You want to know the secret to success in the merchant's trade? Well, Jambo is here to tell you—and I won't even charge you for it! (Though if you feel moved to leave a few coins on my counter, I certainly won't complain.)

LESSON ONE: Know Your Customer
A good merchant doesn't just sell things—he solves problems! That warrior with the dented shield? He needs confidence. That worried mother? She needs peace of mind. You're not peddling potions, my friend—you're peddling hope! And hope, as it turns out, is excellent for business.

LESSON TWO: Honesty is Profitable
Now, I know what you're thinking. "But Jambo, surely a little white lie here and there—" NO! Jambo stops you right there. You lie to a customer once, you lose them forever. You tell the truth? They come back. They bring friends. They trust you with their gold AND their problems. A repeat customer is worth ten times a one-time sale!

LESSON THREE: Location, Location, Location!
Why do you think Jambo set up shop in Grondia? Because this is where the action is! Adventurers coming and going, always needing supplies. Find where people NEED what you have, and you'll never go hungry.

LESSON FOUR: Presentation Matters
You could have the finest restorative in all the land, but if it's sitting in a dusty corner covered in cobwebs, nobody's buying! Keep your wares displayed nicely. A little sparkle, a little shine—it catches the eye and loosens the purse strings.

LESSON FIVE: Know When to Bargain (And When Not To)
Sometimes a customer haggles because they're poor. Sometimes they haggle because they're cheap. Learn the difference! A struggling soul trying to buy medicine for their child? Jambo gives a discount. A pompous noble trying to cheat you for sport? That's when you smile, hold firm, and watch them pay full price anyway.

LESSON SIX: Never Stop Learning
Every customer has a story. Every transaction teaches you something. Maybe it's a new herb you've never heard of. Maybe it's that goblins are raiding the eastern road. Knowledge is inventory too, my friend, and it never weighs you down!

LESSON SEVEN: Treat Everyone with Respect
Rich or poor, human or... well, whatever walks through your door—treat them with dignity. That beggar today might be a merchant prince tomorrow. And even if they're not? It costs you nothing to be kind, and it might just save your soul when you meet your Maker.

LESSON EIGHT: Always Have Change
Nothing kills a sale faster than "Sorry, I can't break that." Jambo always keeps a variety of coins on hand. Small copper, silver, even those rare gold pieces. Be ready for any transaction!

LESSON NINE: Know Your Products
How can you sell something you don't understand? Jambo tests his potions, examines his wares, asks questions of his suppliers. A merchant who says "I don't know" too often is a merchant who doesn't eat!

LESSON TEN: The Customer is NOT Always Right (But You Should Pretend They Are)
Oh yes, Jambo said it! Sometimes customers are wrong, foolish, or trying to take advantage. But you smile, you nod, you find a way to help them see reason without making them feel stupid. An embarrassed customer never returns—but a customer who feels clever? They'll be back tomorrow!

THE GOLDEN RULE OF JAMBO:
Do right by people, and prosperity follows. Cheat them, and maybe you get rich quick—but you'll die poor in spirit. And trust Jambo on this: when you stand before God, He's not going to ask how much gold you got. He'll ask what you did with it.

So! There you have it. Jambo's secrets, freely given. Now go forth, make honest deals, and may your purse be heavy and your conscience light!
