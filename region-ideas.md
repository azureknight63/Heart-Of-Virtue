1. The Wailing Badlands
The Wailing Badlands are a desolate and haunting expanse of jagged, corrupted earth located at the edge of the world's map, where the ground is a deep crimson and nothing grows. The air is thick with a chilling, mournful wind that never ceases, carrying the faint, distorted echoes of sounds and voices from Jean’s past. This place is a physical manifestation of his suppressed grief and guilt.
 * Lore: The Badlands were not always so. They were once vibrant fields, but they have been slowly corrupted by a malevolent force known as the Echoes—lost fragments of Jean's grief given form by the Mind-Eater's influence. As Jean journeys through this land, the wind's wails become clearer, whispering names and phrases that are fragments of his real-world life.
 * New Denizens: The primary inhabitants are Gloom Sprites, ethereal creatures of shadow and sound. They are not hostile but are drawn to despair. They will attempt to sap Jean's resolve by projecting illusions of his loved ones, twisting happy memories into painful what-ifs. The only way to defeat them is to confront the emotions they represent, not by force.
 * Narrative Purpose: This area forces Jean to physically confront his inner pain. It is a crucible that proves his growth and resilience. By navigating this place, he learns that facing his trauma is the only way to heal it and that the world around him is a reflection of his own spiritual state.
2. The Singing Grove
A complete contrast to the Badlands, the Singing Grove is a hidden, vibrant oasis where light, sound, and life are one. This place is a testament to the world's divine creation. The trees here are not wood, but crystallized light, and the ground hums with a quiet, melodic energy.
 * Lore: The grove is home to the Silvans, a race of sentient beings made of pure, harmonious light. They are the original architects of this world's sound, weaving the universe into being through their collective songs. The Silvans can't speak with a normal voice, but their movements and hums are a form of music. They are a physical representation of divine order and creation.
 * New Denizens: The Grove is protected by the Aural Guardians, passive but powerful beings of pure sound. They exist to maintain the harmony of the grove. If a visitor's emotional state is chaotic or their intentions impure, the Guardians will create a jarring dissonance that forces them to leave.
 * Narrative Purpose: Jean will visit the Grove to acquire the Harmonic Key, a crystal that can only be formed from the purest of Silvan songs. This key is necessary to unlock the next part of his journey. The Silvans, in their perfect state, will initially be put off by Jean’s internal turmoil, forcing him to find inner peace and emotional balance before they will assist him. This is a crucial step for him to fully accept his purpose and let go of his pain.
3. The Sanctuary of Illusions
Perched on the side of a cliff face, the Sanctuary is a desolate, abandoned temple, its purpose forgotten by time. Its interior is a confusing maze of shifting walls and impossible corridors. It is the testing ground of truth versus illusion.
 * Lore: The Sanctuary was once a holy site where ancient pilgrims would come to test their faith against their own perceptions. The temple's core is a powerful magical artifact that can project illusions based on the thoughts and fears of those who enter. The temple’s tests were designed to force pilgrims to rely on their intuition and faith rather than their senses.
 * New Denizens: The Sanctuary is now home to Phantoms—creatures that are not hostile, but illusions of a person's deepest fears. For Jean, this would be a constant stream of fleeting illusions of his family being in danger or in moments of happiness he can never have again. These are not real; they are designed to trick him and wear him down.
 * Narrative Purpose: Jean must navigate the Sanctuary by learning to differentiate between the real world and the temple's illusions. His only guide will be his pure, unshakable faith. The lessons he learns here—that what is real is what he feels in his heart, not what he sees with his eyes—will be the final step in preparing him to make his ultimate choice and face the truth. He will learn to trust his faith over the deceptive illusions of his mind.
